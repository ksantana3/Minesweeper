# Minesweeper
Minesweeper Game  
This is a 4 phase project to create the classic game minesweeper. I will be documenting my journey within a Jupyter Notebook.  

Phase 1: Basic Logic.  
Phase 2: Drawing of gameboard grid.  
Phase 3: Linking gameboard grid to logic.  
Phase 4: Interaction with gameboard using mouse.
